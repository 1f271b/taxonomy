    Deswa, is an Indian Bhojpuri language film, written and directed by Nitin Chandra. The film, is a social drama - crime thriller Bhojpuri genre. The first film to be produced by actress Neetu Chandra. The film introduces new actors Ajay Kumar, Deepak Singh and Kranti Prakash Jha in lead roles along with critically acclaimed actor Pankaj Jha and very known Ashish Vidyarthi. In 2010 Neetu Chandra had expressed a hope that it would move beyond the limited release that is common for Bhojpuri films and instead be seen throughout India and perhaps also abroad. She intends that the film would employ multilingual dialogue - Bhojpuri, English, Telugu and Hindi - as well as being dubbed into Tamil and Marathi in order to extend its appeal. She believ that "With "Deswa", we would be redefining the very face of Bhojpuri cinema." Deswa is the first Bhojpuri film in 50 years to get selected at Indian Panorama section of International Film Festival of India, which was enough to support the vision of Neetu Chandra.
